## Unit test


Modify any project that you have already created, to conduct:
<ul>
<li>unit testing for any function</li>
<li>ntegration testing between the unit tested function and a function that calls the function (you may use a driver function)</li>
<li>verification testing that determines whether the system meets the functional requirements.</li>
</ul>
For each exercise, ensure that the output file(s), the appropriately commented source files, test/stub/driver files, and test/final binary files, are part of your github repository.



## Verification Test

<p>The the system was design to measure the voltage with decimal points.A verification test was done ewhere the program is ran with the ADC pin copnnece4d to a 10k pot betweeen Vcc and Gnd. The swiper of the pot was connecred to a voltmeter to measure the voltage to verifiy whether the voltage is being measured by the ADC and ESP32 is within 1 decimal point.</p>
